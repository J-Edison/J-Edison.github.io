        <ol><li>Scraps of Paper<li>Reusable Water Bottles</li> <li>The "Save the Turtles" Movement</li>

<h3>So How Can You Help?</h3>
     <ul><li>Buy used books! Find thrift stores, used book stores, and local book shops near you to checkout their used books collections!</li></ul>
     <ul><li>Donate your old books! If you have old children's books, books that you bought for one class years ago, or a never-ending "TBR" list, consider donating them to a local reused book location to give them another chance in the literary world and to be loved by another reader!</li></ul>
     <ul><li>Use E-readers and audiobooks! Technologies like Kindle, Nook, and Audible are greate examples of digitized literaure that can help reduce paper publications and the waste of unread copies laying around on shelves.</li></ul>
     <ul><li>Do your research! Learn which publishers are more ethical than others, where to donate, and how to be able to make sure your donations are received.
