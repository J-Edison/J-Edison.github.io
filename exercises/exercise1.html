        <h1>A Little About Me!</h1>
        <p>I am a junior English major pursuing a concentration in Professional Writing and Technical Communications, as well as a minor in Business. I enjoy all kinds of writing; persuasive essays, academic papers, creative pieces, poetry, plays, short stories, everything! Currently, I am interning at a Consultant Staffing Agency, learning the ways of sales recruiting. I have interests in sales, technical writing, social media marketing, and applications of literacy in the business world.</p>

    <h2>What is this site? </h2>
        <p>Creating this website is the first step in my English 391c class, where I hope to learn about Web Design and creating a digital platform for myself and my portfolio. If you have any suggestions or want to get in touch, I'd love to hear from you! <a href="mailto:jane.edison7@gmail.com"> Send me an email anytime. </a> </p>
