        <h2>Analytical Essay on “The Grey Woman”</h2>
        <p>This is an essay I wrote for my English 359 class in the Fall 2024 semester for my Victorian Imagination class. This paper is an example of my analytical writing skills in a literary application, as well as my skills in literary analysis. I wrote this essay about the unusual experience of love in “The Grey Woman” through the events that the protagonist experiences. </p>

        <h2>Creative Writing Focus Piece on an Alternate Perspective of an Excerpt</h2>
        <p>This piece of creative writing was also written for my English 359 class, but instead of writing critically or analytically, I instead chose to write creatively and take on the perspective of John Watson instead of Sherlock Holmes for a passage in the novel by SIr Arthur Conan Doyle, “The Sign of Four”. This piece was the for the culmination of my class, where we were allowed to choose to write analytically or creatively. Since my first paper for the class was analytical, I chose to exercise my creative writing skills and apply my readings to writing in an alternate perspective.</p>

        <h2>Proposal for A More Accessibility Focused Museum Guide</h2>
        <p>As part of a group project in my Junior Year Writing class, my group mates and I designed and presented an updated and rethought museum guide for the UMass Museum of Contemporary Art. We kept in mind accessibility standards for patrons looking to visit the museum, guests who are navigating the museum, and for people with disabilities. This project highlights the skills I learned in this class, titled “Writing for Nonprofits”, where we explored many forms of writing and the ways in which they interact with businesses.</p>

        <h2>GBH Frontline Editorial Internship Cover Letter</h2>
        <p>This piece of writing is a cover letter I wrote for an internship opportunity that I was very interested in but ultimately did not end up getting. However, I am still proud of my writing in this, because I showed off my ability to write about myself objectively and in an applicable way to the values and interests that the internship was looking for. It also showcases my professional writing skills and formal style, and how I am able to suit my writing to the expectations and context of which I am writing in or to whom. </p>
